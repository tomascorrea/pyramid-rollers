# Dev Workflow (GitHub Issues)

Guide the developer through the full cycle: issue -> branch -> plan -> implement -> PR -> release.

## GitHub API Access

Before performing any GitHub operations, determine which access method is available:

1. **GitHub MCP** (preferred): Check if a GitHub MCP server is configured by scanning the mcps folder for a server matching `github` or containing `github` in its name. If found, verify with a `get_me` call. Note the server name for all subsequent MCP calls.
2. **gh CLI** (fallback): Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication.

If neither is available, stop and instruct the user to configure one.

Also resolve `owner` and `repo` from the git remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Parse `owner/repo` from the URL. Store these values — GitHub MCP tools require them as explicit parameters.

Use the detected method consistently for all GitHub operations below. Each operation shows both methods: **MCP** first, then **CLI**.

## Resume (Continuing from a Previous Chat)

If resuming an in-progress workflow (the user selected "Continue current work" from the chat triage), follow these steps instead of starting from Step 1:

1. Get the current branch name:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

2. Extract the issue number from the branch name. Branches follow the pattern `<type>/<issue-number>-<slug>` (e.g., `fix/42-login-timeout` → issue `42`).

3. Fetch the issue details and comments:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=issue_read
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "issue_number": <number>, "method": "get" }
```

Then fetch comments:

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=issue_read
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "issue_number": <number>, "method": "get_comments" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,number,comments
```

4. Search the issue comments for an **Implementation Plan**. If found:
   - Parse the plan tasks
   - Cross-reference with the git log (`git log main..HEAD --oneline`) to determine which tasks are likely completed
   - Create TodoWrite entries: mark completed tasks as `completed`, set the next unfinished task to `in_progress`, rest as `pending`
   - Tell the user what was found and which task you'll resume from
   - Continue from **Step 5: Execute**

5. If no plan is found in the comments:
   - Tell the user the issue context and that no plan was stored yet
   - Continue from **Step 3: Plan**

---

## Step 1: Issue

Use AskQuestion:

```
prompt: "Do you already have a GitHub issue for this work?"
options:
  - Yes, I have an issue URL
  - No, let's create one
```

### If the user has an issue

Ask for the issue URL or number. Fetch the issue details:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=issue_read
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "issue_number": <number>, "method": "get" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,number
```

Parse the title, description, and labels for context.

### If the user does not have an issue

Discuss the work with the user to define:
- **Title**: concise summary
- **Description**: what needs to happen and why
- **Labels**: bug, feature, enhancement, etc.

When the issue is well-defined, create it:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=issue_write
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "method": "create", "title": "<title>", "body": "<description>", "labels": ["<label1>", "<label2>"] }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<description>" --label "<labels>"
```

Capture the issue number from the output.

## Step 2: Branch

Determine the branch type from labels or context:
- `bug` label -> `fix/`
- `feature` or `enhancement` label -> `feat/`
- otherwise -> `task/`

Create a slug from the issue title (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars).

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<issue-number>-<slug>
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Example: `fix/42-login-timeout`

## Step 3: Plan

Tell the user: "Switching to plan mode to design the implementation."

Use the SwitchMode tool to enter plan mode. Then create an implementation plan by:
1. Reading the issue description
2. Exploring the relevant parts of the codebase
3. Drafting a step-by-step plan with specific files and changes

The plan should include:
- A summary of the approach
- Ordered list of tasks (each should be a concrete, testable unit of work)
- Files to create or modify per task
- Test strategy

Wait for the user to review and approve the plan.

## Step 4: Store Plan

Once the plan is approved:

1. Post the plan as a comment on the issue:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=add_issue_comment
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "issue_number": <number>, "body": "## Implementation Plan\n\n<the approved plan>" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Implementation Plan

<paste the approved plan here>

EOF
)"
```

2. Create TodoWrite entries for each task in the plan. Set the first task to `in_progress`, the rest to `pending`.

## Step 5: Execute

Switch back to agent mode using the SwitchMode tool.

Work through the tasks sequentially:
1. Pick the current `in_progress` task
2. Implement the changes
3. Run tests if applicable
4. Mark the task as `completed` in TodoWrite
5. Move the next task to `in_progress`

After completing each task, post a progress comment on the issue:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=add_issue_comment
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "issue_number": <number>, "body": "Completed: <task description>" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "Completed: <task description>"
```

## Step 6: Sync

Throughout execution, keep the issue and TodoWrite aligned:
- When a task is completed locally, comment on the issue
- If the plan needs adjustment mid-execution, update both the TodoWrite list and post an updated plan comment on the issue
- If new tasks emerge, add them to both TodoWrite and the issue

After all implementation tasks are complete, post a completion summary on the issue before proceeding.

## Step 7: Update Knowledge

Before creating the PR, update the project's knowledge files:

1. Check if the changes affect a feature area that has an existing `knowledge/*.md` file — if so, read the file and update any sections that are now stale. Rewrite sections to reflect the current state rather than appending notes.
2. If a new feature area was introduced and no knowledge file exists, create one following the structure in `.cursor/rules/knowledge.mdc` (Overview, Design Decisions, API Surface, Key Learnings / Gotchas).
3. If the changes affect the overall architecture, update `knowledge/architecture.md`.
4. Commit knowledge updates separately:

```bash
git add knowledge/
git commit -m "docs: update knowledge for <feature>"
```

## Step 8: Verify

Before creating the PR, run the full test suite and linter to confirm nothing is broken:

1. Run the project's test suite (e.g., `pytest`, `go test`, `flutter test`). **All tests must pass.**
2. Run the project's linter/formatter checks (e.g., `ruff check .`, `black --check .`).
3. If tests or lints fail, fix the issues and re-run until green.
4. Do **not** proceed to the PR step with failing tests.

## Step 9: Pull Request

When all tasks are complete and tests pass:

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Push the branch: `git push`
3. Create the PR:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=create_pull_request
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "title": "<issue-title>", "body": "## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\nCloses #<issue-number>\n\n## Test plan\n<checklist>", "head": "<branch-name>", "base": "main" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh pr create --title "<issue-title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing what was done>

Closes #<issue-number>

## Test plan
<checklist of how to verify the changes>

EOF
)"
```

4. Tell the user the PR is ready for review and provide the PR URL.

## Step 10: Review & Merge

After the PR is created, use the **`AskQuestion`** tool:

```
prompt: "The PR is open. What would you like to do?"
options:
  - Check review status now
  - PR is approved, please merge
  - Come back later — I'll request a review myself
```

### If "Check review status now"

1. Check CI status and review state:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=pull_request_read
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "pullNumber": <number>, "method": "get_check_runs" }
```

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=pull_request_read
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "pullNumber": <number>, "method": "get_reviews" }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh pr checks
gh pr view --json reviewDecision,reviews,statusCheckRollup
```

2. Summarize the current state:
   - CI checks: passing / failing / pending
   - Review status: approved / changes requested / pending / no reviewers

3. **If checks pass and reviews are approved**, use **AskQuestion**:

```
prompt: "PR is approved and checks pass. Merge it?"
options:
  - Yes, squash and merge
  - Yes, merge commit
  - Yes, rebase and merge
  - No, not yet
```

4. If the user selects a merge strategy:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=merge_pull_request
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "pullNumber": <number>, "merge_method": "<squash|merge|rebase>" }
```

Then switch to main locally:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh pr merge --<strategy> --delete-branch
git checkout main && git pull
```

5. If checks are failing or reviews are not yet approved, tell the user what is pending and suggest coming back later.

### If "PR is approved, please merge"

Use **AskQuestion**:

```
prompt: "Which merge strategy?"
options:
  - Squash and merge
  - Merge commit
  - Rebase and merge
```

Then merge:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=merge_pull_request
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "pullNumber": <number>, "merge_method": "<squash|merge|rebase>" }
```

Then switch to main locally:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh pr merge --<strategy> --delete-branch
git checkout main && git pull
```

### If "Come back later"

Tell the user they can resume this step by asking to check the PR status or merge. End the current session here — the Release step runs after the PR is merged.

## Step 11: Release

> This step only applies to projects with a release flow.

After the PR is merged:

### 11.1 Determine the next version

1. Detect the latest release tag:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=list_releases
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "perPage": 1 }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh release list --limit 1
```

2. Determine the next version using semantic versioning:
   - Bug fix -> patch bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
   - Feature -> minor bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
   - Breaking change -> major bump (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)

   Use the issue labels and nature of changes to decide.

### 11.2 Bump the version in source files

The version in source files **must** match the release tag. Skipping this step causes CI publish failures (e.g., PyPI rejects duplicate versions).

1. Detect where the version is defined. Check in order:
   - `pyproject.toml` — look for a static `version = "x.y.z"` under `[project]` or `[tool.poetry]`
   - `version.py` or `src/<package>/__version__.py` — a standalone version file
   - `src/<package>/__init__.py` — a `__version__` variable

2. Update **all** version sources found to the new version number.

3. Confirm with the user before committing:

Use **AskQuestion**:

```
prompt: "Release v<new-version> (current: v<current-version>). Bump version and create release?"
options:
  - Yes, bump and release
  - Change the version number
  - Skip release for now
```

If "Change the version number", ask for the desired version. If "Skip release for now", stop here.

4. Commit and push the version bump:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "bump: v<version>"
git push
```

### 11.3 Create the release

> No GitHub MCP equivalent exists for release creation — use `gh` CLI regardless of the detected method.

```bash
gh release create v<version> --generate-notes --title "v<version>"
```

### 11.4 Verify the release pipeline

After creating the release, check that the triggered CI workflow succeeds:

**Via MCP:**

```
CallMcpTool: server=github, toolName=actions_list
arguments: { "owner": "<owner>", "repo": "<repo>", "method": "list_workflow_runs", "per_page": 1 }
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
gh run list --limit 1 --json name,status,conclusion,url
```

If the workflow is still running, wait and re-check. If it fails, tell the user immediately with the run URL — do not wait for them to discover it.

Tell the user the release has been created and whether the publish pipeline succeeded.

## Step 12: End

Summarize what was accomplished:
- Issue number and title
- Branch name
- Number of commits
- PR URL
- Release version (if applicable)
